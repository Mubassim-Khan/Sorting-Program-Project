# Sorting Program in Java (Project)
This Repository contains sorting program in Java, which contains 10 Sorting methods/algorithms, helpful for understanding the purpose & method of as well as structure of programs.

Following are the Sorting Methods available:

#### 1. Bubble Sort
#### 2. Insertion Sort
#### 3. Selection Sort
#### 4. Merge Sort
#### 5. Quick Sort
#### 6. Shell Sort
#### 7. Heap Sort
#### 8. Counting Sort
#### 9. Radix Sort
#### 10. Bucket Sort

## Features

- Searching: These programs are made to search a integer data in array.
- Multiple Search: By using iterative approach, multiple searches were made possible by using different methods of searching as per user requirment.
- Recursion: Few of the methods are made with the logic of recursion.
- Time Complexity: By using the method of recursion, compilation is made in least possible run-time.
- Efficient: Recursion reduces runtime complexity as well as it allows program to take smaller size in memory to store.
- Wide Range of Selection: A user can select any sorting method from any of 10 methods & still have choice to use other method in same running time.
- Space Complexity: The space complexity for these algorithms depends on how many times they call themselves recursively and also their size of input arrays.
